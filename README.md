# Unhandled Null/Undefined Result After Null Check in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript where null checks are performed, but the possibility of a null or undefined result from subsequent operations is not handled.

## The Bug
The `foo` function checks if either `a` or `b` is null. If so, it returns null. However, if either `a` or `b` is undefined, or if some operation later in the function results in a null or undefined value, it can still cause errors. 

## The Solution
The corrected `foo` function adds more comprehensive null checks to ensure all paths of execution handle the possibility of null or undefined values. It uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide default values in those cases.
